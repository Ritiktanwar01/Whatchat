# 🛠️ Whatchat Backend

This repository contains the **backend logic** for the Whatchat application—a real-time chat platform designed to deliver seamless and secure messaging experiences.

This part of the app is responsible for:
- Managing database operations
- Handling Socket.IO connections
- Powering real-time communication between users

Our goal is to build a robust backend that scales efficiently and ensures privacy, speed, and reliability.

## 🚀 Upcoming Features

1. **Redis-Based Messaging Queues**
   - Improve message delivery speed and reliability
   - Enable scalable pub/sub architecture for real-time events

2. **End-to-End Message Encryption**
   - Messages will be encrypted at the client level
   - Even developers and database admins won’t be able to read user messages
   - Designed with zero-knowledge architecture principles

## 🧠 Vision

We’re building Whatchat to be a privacy-first, developer-friendly chat platform that can scale to thousands of concurrent users. This backend is the foundation for that vision.

Stay tuned for updates and contributions!
